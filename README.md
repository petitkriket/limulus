Horseshoe crabs (or limulus) have developed a super efficient immune system. Their blood is [harvested](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00185/full) because it contain a very sensitive compound useful to detect bacterial contamination and has anti-bacterial properties. They are called living fossils has it’s been around for 450M of years and saves millions of human lives every year. It’s blue blood [cost](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-horseshoe-crab-blood-expensive-2018-8?IR=T) \$60k per gallon

# Gameplay possibilities

### Type speed shooting game

Typespeed basic idea [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENF_q-rRrcU&t=45s)
Typespeed shooting game visally enhanced : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFrIADy0nU)

 1. User type bacterias to make them disappear
2. If user get touched by a bacteria name, gameover
3. More and more bacteria appears
4. Add visual feedback : ray-gun energy, orient the gun towards word position
5. Soundtrack is playing in the background
6. If bottom is reached by a word : game is over, YOLO
7. High score table using Rails CRUD (later NodeJS)

  

## Level design

The game is set within the human body. A horseschoe crab (limulus) would shoot name of bacterias as they arrive in order to clean and heal the host.
As it's within an actual body, it's kind of low light environnement with flowing organisms, as inside deep water. We would hear some repetitive music, close to heart beat, muted as into the water.

Soft and easy shooting game at the beginning which turn to survival horror as enemies number increases and the patient condition get worse. Because at some point, everybody dies, games ends when bacterias opponents swarm and overwhelm the body immune defense (everybody dies eventually) 👻

### Sound Design

Jeff Mills musical theme of Fantastic Voyage commissioned by Cinémathèque Française and Cité de la Musique in 2009 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHkIrYEmjyo) to give a sense of rythm and fasten gameplay pace.

## Features List

### Basic game implementation (MVP)

 ~~create canvas and html~~
 ~~position four words first~~
~~- type and check match on submit~~ 
~~- remove matching words (kills/heals)~~
~~- add points and update score~~
 ~~words moving~~
 ~~add user image~~
 ~~- user alignement with target~~
~~- game over when health reached bottom~~
~~- words parsed from a text~~
~~- opening titles screen~~
~~- closing screen~~
- reset game variables
-  launch next wave array reseed
- bacteria appear mostly on top screen

### Extras

- background music
-  link CRUD and front
- add animated wow instructions on screen
> type to heal !
 >limulus gone..
 >good job, next wave !
 -   add visual feedback on destroy
-   add audio feedback on destroy
- bacterias icons
-  difficulty (words length rising)
- user rotation to target on match
-  user translation on match (x,y)
-   give an visual feedback on type error (form validation pulse)
-   particles flowing down (simulate speed)
~~   add visual feedback on health +/-~~
  ~~glowing particles and depth~~
~~- health points management~~
~~- dynamic input monitoring~~

**Fantastic Voyage** (1966) A classic sci-fi low budget movie after an Isac Asimov novel. Also an hommage to **Jean Painlevé**, a scientist wanna be artists who made videos about sea creatures, concept of time and space and popular vulgarisation

  

The mesmerizing, utterly unclassifiable science films of Jean Painlevé (1902-89) have to be seen to be believed: delightful, surrealist-influenced dream works that are also serious science. The French filmmaker-scientist-inventor had a decades-spanning career in which he created hundreds of short films on subjects ranging from astronomy to pigeons to, most famously, such marine-life marvels as the sea horse and the sea urchin. _(The Criterion)_
