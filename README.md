Horseshoe crabs (or limulus) have developed a super efficient immune system. Their blood is [harvested](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00185/full) because it contain a very sensitive compound useful to detect bacterial contamination and has anti-bacterial properties. They are called living fossils has it‚Äôs been around for 450M of years and saves millions of human lives every year. It‚Äôs blue blood [cost](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-horseshoe-crab-blood-expensive-2018-8?IR=T) \$60k per gallon

  

# Gameplay possibilities

  

### Type speed shooting game

  

Typespeed basic idea [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENF_q-rRrcU&t=45s)

  

Typespeed shooting game visally enhanced : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFrIADy0nU)

  

1. User type bacterias to make them disappear
2. If user get touched by a bacteria name, gameover
3. More and more bacteria appears
4. Add visual feedback : ray-gun energy, orient the gun towards word position
5. Soundtrack is playing in the background
6.  If bottom is reached by a word : game is over, YOLO
7. High score table using Rails CRUD (later NodeJS)

## Level design

  

The game is set within the human body. A horseschoe crab shaped gun would shoot name of bacteria as they arrive in order to clean and heal the host.

  

As it's within an actual body, it's kind of low light environnement with flowing organisms, as inside deep water. We would hear some repetitive music, close to heart beat, muted as into the water.

  

Kind of soft and easy shooting game at the begining which turn to survival horror as enemies number increases and the patient condition get worse. Because at some point, everybody dies, games ends when bacterias opponents swarm and overwhelm the body immune defense (everybody dies eventually) üëª

  

### Sound Design
Jeff Mills musical theme of Fantastic Voyage commissioned by Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise and Cit√© de la Musique in 2009 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHkIrYEmjyo) to give a sense of rythm and fasten gameplay pace.

## References
**Fantastic Voyage** (1966) A classic sci-fi low budget movie after an Isac Asimov novel. Also an hommage to **Jean Painlev√©**, a scientist wanna be artists who made videos about sea creatures, concept of time and space and popular vulgarisation

The mesmerizing, utterly unclassifiable science films of Jean Painlev√© (1902-89) have to be seen to be believed: delightful, surrealist-influenced dream works that are also serious science. The French filmmaker-scientist-inventor had a decades-spanning career in which he created hundreds of short films on subjects ranging from astronomy to pigeons to, most famously, such marine-life marvels as the sea horse and the sea urchin. _(The Criterion)_
